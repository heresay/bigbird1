        <p>I am a 6-year-old walking, talking canary. I have long, bright orange legs.<br>
        I am 8 feet 2 inches tall and my nest is on Sesame Street. I sleep with a teddy bear named Radar.<br>
        I am neighbors with a grouch, who takes care of a worm named Wormie.</p></td>

    <h3>Frequent Misunderstandings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I once sung the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvhKZHAP8U">alphabet</a> as one long word.<br> I wondered what it meant afterwards.</li>
      <li>I refer to the grocer Mr. Hooper as "Mr.Looper".</li>
      <li>At one point none of the human adults on Sesame Street saw Snuffy,<br> my best friend,
      they thought I made up him to stay out of trouble.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What I've Learned</h3>
    <p>I've learned to read and write while on Sesame Street.</p>
    <p>Learning the alphabet has helped me with my reading and writing.</p>
    <p>I recently spoke on a podcast "Foley and Friends". <br>
       We talked about life in lockdown and birdseed banana bread.</p>
